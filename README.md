# Rusty


## Why?

ðŸš€ This is going to be my learning process for Rust

ðŸ§¨ðŸ§¨ I will have Rust installed on various OS's and downloaded to play with. 


## What? 

Not sure yet. I'll see where this takes me and I'm looking to learn from TCM Security and other places +
to Sharpen my skill set. 





1. I installed Rust from Here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2. Created this Repo for storing code and making changes

3. I started watching the YouTube video ![rusty/Assets/Learn Rust Programming in 2 Hors.png](https://youtu.be/RU7BYxmSBNg?si=ZcgmrurE3Rwj8C8q)
