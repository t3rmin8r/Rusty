# Rusty


## Why?

This is going to be my learning process for Rust

I will have Rust installed on various OS's and downloaded to play with. 


## What? 

Not sure yet. I'll see where this takes me and I'm looking to learn from TCM Security and other places +
to Sharpen my skillset. 





1. I installed Rust from Here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

2. Created this Repo for storing code and making changes

3. I'll start by watching this video: https://youtu.be/RU7BYxmSBNg?si=IrvFGIoUSkbTij6z
